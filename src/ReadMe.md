The /src sub-folder contains all source files (R files from RStudio, R files from Jupyter Notebook, Python files from Jupyter Notebook, SQL files etc.)

``` XgboostExp1.ipynb ``` is the file where basic IRIS dataset is used to showcase the workings of xgboost in R.  

``` XgboostExp2.ipynb ``` is the file where another Arthritis dataset in VCD package is considered to demonstrate usage of XGBoost in R. Some of the objectives are to understand how features are calibrated to check if they impact overall model performance in the context of using XGBoost algorithm. It also showcases, how to prepare the dataset to create a sparse matrix structure from a simple Arthritis dataset to see how computed parameters can be created for handling categorical information, handling factor parameters.
