# BRUG meetup

### This repository captures most of my presentations / information shared in Bangalore R User Group meetups.

Disclaimer: 
- The contents of this document are to best of my knowledge and experiences. Some data and names MAY BE tweaked to take care of data privacy and business sensitivity aspects. The information provided is purely to highlight experience gathered with clear business impact created as part of opportunities and NO WAY RELATES TO ANY ORGANIZATION. 
- Purpose is for knowledge sharing and learning as much as possible.


## 1. Deep Learning using R

- P.S: Please refer to the DeepLearning_using_R.pdf for details.
- Objective is to provide a very high level view about Deep learning and some packages in R. Example of MNIST dataset can be leveraged to showcase the use of R using various libraries.


## 2. Packages / Libraries in R

Please refer to Packages_and_OOP_in_R.pdf deck for content on the presentation conducted as part of BRUG. This focuses on Packages and OOP in R (at a high level).

- P.S.: The following list does not involve entire exhaustive list. However, the intent is to provide some key and important packages that are used and helpful in most CRISP-DM phases.
